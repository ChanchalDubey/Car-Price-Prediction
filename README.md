This dataset contains information about used cars listed on [website](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv) This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of Random Forest Regressor in Machine Learning. The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

Column name    | Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Car_Name       | Name of Car sold
Year	       | Year in which car was bought
Selling_Price  | Price at which car sold
Present_Price  | Price of same car model in current year
Kms_Driven     | Number of Kilometers Car driven before it is sold
Fuel_Type      | Type of fuel Car uses
Seller_Type    | Type of seller
Transmission   | Gear transmission of the car (Automatic/Manual)
Owner	       | Number of previous owners
